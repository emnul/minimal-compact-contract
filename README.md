# Minimal Compact Repo

This repo was created to quickly test and reproduce Compact bugs.

## Getting Started

This repository assumes the Compact toolchain is locally installed. Please refer to the [Compact toolchain installation
instructions](https://github.com/LFDT-Minokawa/compact#user-documentation) for more information on how to install the Compact compiler
if not installed already.

Run the following command to test Compact examples.

```bash
npm install && npm run test
```
